## Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) Application

Proposed by: Joshua Kent ([jkent40@gatech.edu](mailto:jkent40@gatech.edu))

The Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) is a metric used by trained professionals (physical therapists, certified trainers, etc.) to help patients recovering from concussions and usually those suffering from post-concussive symptoms (PCS). This project will digitalize the traditional test into a mobile IOS application so it can be conducted more efficiently and use the data to give better insight about the recovery of the patient.

Personally, I have done this test in physical therapy when I have recovered from multiple concussions. I have first hand experience with it and know certain areas where digitalizing the process can bring significant improvement. I would like to form a team to further develop this project and see where it goes. I would love to hear any feedback, intertest, etc. and would be more than happy to discuss further details!

The following link is to a PDF that outlines the BCTT so you can see what application will be required to do:

Additional preliminary research:

- [The Predictive Capacity of the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test After Sport-Related Concussion in Adolescents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6492460/)
- [Use of graded exercise testing in concussion and return-to-activity management](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Fulltext/2013/11000/Use_of_Graded_Exercise_Testing_in_Concussion_and.8.aspx)

Skills:

- IOS development (This will be MOST of the work)
  - General development
  - Apple Watch/Fitbit interaction
- UI/UX work
  - Making the application functionable, easy to use, and aesthetic
- Clinical Knowledge (Don&#39;t need to have, just interest in learning)
  - Researching BCTT
  - Using research to displaying proper safety measures and make future suggestions
- \*Any skills for features you can think of works too!

1. **Description**

The Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test (BCTT) is a metric used by trained professionals (physical therapists, certified trainers, etc.) to help patients recovering from concussions and usually those suffering from post-concussive symptoms (PCS). This project will digitalize the traditional test into a mobile iOS application so it can be conducted more efficiently and use the data to give better insight about the recovery of the patient.

1. **Motivation**

Personally, I (Josh) have done this test in physical therapy when I recovered from multiple concussions over the past couple years. I have first hand experience with it and know certain areas where digitalizing the process can bring significant improvement to those going through a similar process as me. By storing the data on the device, we will be able to provide recovery analytics that would&#39;ve been infeasible previously.

There has been an increasing push to digitize information in the healthcare industry, as the storage of digital information allows for better record-keeping and accountability, as well as the potential to take advantage of big data for better patient care **[cite source]**.
